# Abstract : Impact of Key Performance Indicators and Home Advantage on Match Outcomes in Top 14 Rugby: A Data-Driven Analysis Using Machine Learning

## Objectives:
This study aimed to: i) identify key performance indicators (KPIs) associated with match outcomes in the French Top 14 rugby competition; ii) evaluate the effectiveness of a reduced set of KPIs in predicting match results; and iii) examine the impact of home advantage on both model performance and individual KPIs.

## Methods: 
A retrospective analysis was conducted using relative performance data from 1,085 unique matches played between 2017 and 2023 in the Top 14 rugby competition. Twenty-seven KPIs were initially selected for analysis. A multi-method feature selection approach was employed to identify key predictors, combining Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV), Random Forest Classifier Feature Importance, and Permutation Importance. Random forest classification was performed on both full and reduced datasets, using a binary match outcome (win/lose) as the target variable. The models' predictive accuracies were compared using McNemar's test. The impact of home advantage on KPIs was assessed using paired t-tests and effect sizes.

## Results:
he reduced model, based on seven KPIs, achieved similar predictive accuracy to the full model (approximately 84% for both wins and losses), with no statistically significant difference (χ² = 0.0, p = 1.0). The key predictors identified were: home-away status, kicks from hand meters, carries meters, clean breaks, turnovers conceded, passes, and mauling meters. Home advantage significantly influenced six out of seven KPIs, with medium to large effect sizes observed.

## Conclusions:
Relative performance indicators effectively predict match outcomes in the Top 14. A reduced set of KPIs maintains predictive accuracy while simplifying interpretation. Kicking emerges as a crucial factor in determining match success, reflecting evolving tactical trends in modern rugby. The study highlights the exceptionally strong home advantage in the Top 14, affecting both match outcomes and the expression of key performance indicators.

# Practical implications

- Effective kicking strategies are essential for success in the Top 14, particularly in light of recent rule changes such as the 50:22 law.
- Performance analysis should focus on a streamlined set of KPIs for more actionable insights.
- Teams should develop tailored strategies for home and away performances to address the strong home advantage effect in the Top 14.
- Future research should explore more granular analysis of specific KPIs, particularly penalties, and investigate strategies to mitigate the home advantage effect.
